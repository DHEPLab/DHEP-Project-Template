## Quarto

This is a Quarto document, a successor to [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. This chunk should output `"~/data"`, the configured path for a data folder that you might include in your `config.yml` file.

```{r config}
config <- config::get()

config$path$rawdata
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r source-function}
source('src/utilities/functions.R')
```
